## Our problem

Imagine this: your friend Chris lives in Mile End, and you live in Imperial Wharf. This journey takes you over an hour, but for Chris, it's just a fifteen minute walk to Brick Lane, where you're meeting. 

Today is the third time in a month that you've made this journey to see Chris, because Chris thinks Brick Lane "is just, so cool" and he doesn't want to travel "all that way" to your part of London, where there's "not even anything to do". 

And, well, you can't really argue with Chris because you can't think of anywhere else to meet that cuts both journey times and is, well, "so cool".

Wouldn't it be wonderful to have an app that allows you to input two postcodes, and in return gives you loads of great venues to meet at? Venues in the middle of both of you?

## Main user journey

As a user, I want to find a convenient, suitable place to meet my friend in an easy and unanimous way.
